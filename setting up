Setting up CodeCommit
1. Create a CodeCommit repository using the AWS console
2. Create an IAM user with programmatic access. Generate a set of CodeCommit
credentials for this user and note them down.
3. Install Git on your local machine. We recommend installing the Gitbash terminal to
have a Git-ready environment.
4. Create an empty directory in your local machine and navigate to it using the terminal.
5. Use the git clone command and the HTTPS URL of the repository to set up the remote
repository. Enter the credentials generated in Step 2 in this page when prompted.
6. Copy the Lambda function files into the directory created in Step 4. This includes the
buildspec and SAM files as well. Use the git add, git commit and git push commands
to push the files into the repository.

Setting up CodeBuild
1. Create a new CodeBuild project using the AWS console
2. Ensure that the project uses CodeCommit as the source. Select the repository
created previously
3. Use the latest Standard Ubuntu CodeBuild 6.0 environment for the build
environment.
4. Make sure to create a new service role for the project.
5. Create a new S3 bucket and use this bucket to store artifacts for the project.

Setting up CodePipeline
1. Create a new pipeline using the AWS console
2. Select the CodeCommit repository created previously as the source for this pipeline
3. Select the CodeBuild project created previously for the build stage
4. Use CloudFormation as the deployment platform.Ensure that the IAM role used for
CloudFormation has access to S3 and AWS Lambda and the following capabilities,
CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND are added to the list of
CloudFormation’s capabilities
5. Run the pipeline to deploy the Lambda function
6. Set up separate CodeCommit repositories, CodeBuildprojects and pipelines for each
of the Lambda functions provided.

Setting up API Gateway
1. Create a new HTTP Gateway using the AWS console
2. Under Integrations,add the Lambda functions search-gateway and searchFunction
3. Under Routes, add the following routes
○ Method : Any, Route : / , Integration Target : search-gateway
○ Method : Any, Route : /search , Integration Target : searchFunction
